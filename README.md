# Technical Interview Problems with Solution Source Code

The problems in this repository are extracted from "Programming Interviews
Exposed: Secrets to Landing Your Next Job" by Mongan et al. 

Solutions were implemented by myself in Python. The chapters covered are the
following: 
* Chapter 6: Arrays and Strings 
* Chapter 7: Recursion

I encourage you to open issues if you find bugs or possible improvements (time
or space complexity) in my solutions. Similarly, if you have additional
problems and/or solution source code that you would like to share with others,
feel free to submit a pull request. 

Good luck for your interview preparation!
