# Technical Interview Problems with Solution Source Code

The problems in this repository are extracted from "Programming Interviews
Exposed: Secrets to Landing Your Next Job" by Mongan et al. 

Solutions were implemented by myself in Python. I encourage you to open issues
if you find bugs or possible improvements (time or space complexity) in my
solutions. Similarly, if you have additional problems and/or solution source
code that you would like to share with others, feel free to submit a pull
request. 

Good luck for your interview preparation!
